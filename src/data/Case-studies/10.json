      "text": "The client wanted a smooth LMS experience to support internal AI certification. But we faced several technical issues that made this difficult. The LMS wasn’t storing scores properly, and it only showed the most recent quiz attempt not the best one. Learners also couldn’t start the module from the beginning after exiting. These bugs created a confusing and inconsistent experience, which could affect learner motivation and the overall certification process."

      "text": "Although the course content and design were ready, we ran into multiple LMS issues mainly with assessments. The quiz included a timer and scoring logic that the LMS didn’t support out of the box. So, we built custom solutions using JavaScript to make the timer work for each question. We also adjusted the backend setup to store the highest score, not just the last one. For the restart issue, we tweaked SCORM settings so learners could reopen the module from the beginning. These fixes helped make the learner experience smoother and more reliable-creating a certification-ready flow suitable for a training management system rollout."
