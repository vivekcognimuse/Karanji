      "title": "The Situation",
      "text": "The client was producing an episode for a YouTube crime series. The story featured a murder at a resort, where a girl was killed by her friend. During the investigation, one of the characters had a phone with a video that captured the murder. The video needed to be shown playing on the phone screen during a heated argument scene. The footage of the murder was provided by the client, and our job was to make it look like it was playing on the phone during the investigation scene."

    "theChallenge": {
      "title": "The Challenge",
      "text": "The main challenge was to insert the provided murder video onto the phone screen shown in the investigation video. Since this was a video inside another video, it had to look real. We used a green screen on the phone during filming and later had to replace it with the actual murder footage. The phone was moving slightly in the shot, so we had to make sure the inserted video matched the phone’s movement and lighting to make it look natural."

    "solution": {
      "title": "Our Solution",
      "text": "We tested tracking using After Effects’ built-in 'Track Motion' feature and tried using 'Mocha AE.' Mocha AE gave us better results for this kind of screen replacement, so we went ahead with it. Our task was to place the murder footage on the phone and make it fit with the motion, angle, and lighting of the scene so it looked like it was playing during the conversation."
