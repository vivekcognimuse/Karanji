      "text": "Creating a video animation set in a rural village theme, while aligning with corporate messaging, was a unique challenge. We had to design a Panchayat-style narrative and ensure the animation style, language, and characters felt authentic to the employees. Each character’s voice had to match the local tone and style, requiring custom voice recordings in a village-style Kannada accent. Meeting these cultural and creative expectations required close attention to detail, rapid feedback loops, and strong collaboration with the client team."
